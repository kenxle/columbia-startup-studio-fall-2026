# Restroom Ready — Repo Setup

Product repository: [nyc-restroom](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom).

## Application framework

We chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) for the web application so the landing page and restroom-discovery pages can be developed in the same project. The application has not been scaffolded yet.

## Feature development process

We chose [Feature Forge](https://github.com/kenxle/feature-forge/blob/main/README.md) because its brief, plan, build, verify, ship, and learn stages connect each small feature to a user problem and evidence that it works.

The process is documented in the product repository’s [docs/feature_development.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/docs/feature_development.md) and in AGENTS.md below. Each feature gets a Markdown record with scope, acceptance criteria, implementation slices, review findings, actual verification results, delivery status, and lessons. Planning, implementation, and independent review have separate responsibilities. Relevant personas review the same version of user-facing work. The team’s current authorization governs commits, PRs, merges, and deployment.

We are adopting the workflow through these project documents; Feature Forge slash-command skills have not been installed.

## Current setup

The product repository contains:

- [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/AGENTS.md), including the chosen process and agent rules;
- [docs/brand_position.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/docs/brand_position.md), copied from the current course document with its supporting links adjusted;
- [docs/style_guide.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/docs/style_guide.md), containing the B/E/F layout specifications, color tokens, typography, spacing, components, accessibility rules, and selected logo;
- [docs/brief.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/docs/brief.md), describing the proposed first product slice and acceptance criteria;
- [docs/feature_development.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/docs/feature_development.md), including stage handoffs and a reusable feature record;
- [brand/logo/README.md](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/brand/logo/README.md), with the selected R tile exports, wordmarks, variants, avatar, and favicons;
- [diagrams/product_flow.mmd](https://github.com/imnotmomo/nyc-restroom/blob/main/diagrams/product_flow.mmd), describing the proposed browse, comparison, and reporting flow.

The selected logo is **03 — R tile**, and its complete set is copied into the product repository. B, E, and F remain available for later page comparisons, with concrete rules for each direction. Style history and browser check results are copied into `docs/style_history/`. Supporting research, persona definitions, and review records remain in the course repository and are linked on GitHub. There is no runnable Next.js application yet; supported installation, development, test, and build commands will be added when it is scaffolded.

## Project

This repository supports **Restroom Ready**, a proposed NYC restroom discovery tool.

The product helps people decide which restroom to use before making the trip by showing:

- entry rules
- restroom conditions
- the route inside the building
- when information was last reported
- what information is still unknown

The current product name is still a working name and may change.

## Application framework

Use **Next.js** for the web application. The repository has not been scaffolded yet; add the supported installation, development, test, and build commands when application code is added.

## Before making changes

Before editing user-facing copy, UX, or product behavior:

1. Read `docs/brand_position.md`.
2. Read `docs/style_guide.md`.
3. Check relevant persona-agent feedback when making major user-facing changes.
4. Do not invent product capabilities, live data, user counts, testimonials, or verified restroom information.
5. If information is missing or uncertain, label it clearly instead of guessing.

## Product principles

Follow these principles across product, copy, and design decisions:

- Make uncertainty visible.
- Let users judge what works for them.
- Prefer specific information over vague ratings.
- Keep interactions fast and practical.
- Separate building-entry access from restroom access.
- Do not claim information is real-time unless a real live data source supports that claim.
- Do not present visitor reports as guarantees.

## Brand language

Preferred language includes:

- “Know before you go.”
- “Find a restroom you can use.”
- “Purchase required”
- “Restroom floor”
- “Stairs to restroom”
- “Last reported”
- “Not reported”

Avoid unsupported or overly broad claims such as the following.
“Real-time” and “Available right now” are only allowed if a live data source supports them:

- “Guaranteed clean”
- “Always open”
- “Available right now”
- “Real-time”
- “The safest bathrooms”
- “Everyone can use it”

For complete positioning and copy rules, see `docs/brand_position.md`.

## Design

Follow `docs/style_guide.md` for:

- colors
- typography
- spacing
- visual tone
- logo usage
- UI patterns

Do not introduce new fonts, colors, or visual styles without a clear reason.

The selected logo is **03 — R tile**. Approved marks, outlined wordmarks, lockups, light/dark and one-color variants, avatars, and favicons are in `brand/logo/`. Follow `brand/logo/README.md` for sizing and clear space; use the supplied exports instead of redrawing the mark. The style guide specifies the three retained page directions, B/E/F. Keep one direction consistent within a page.

## Persona agents

The course repository contains the current definitions:

- [Maya](https://github.com/imnotmomo/columbia-startup-studio-fall-2026/blob/team-fivegirls/teams/fivegirls/hw4-synthesis-brand-position/personas/judge-maya.md)
- [Chloe](https://github.com/imnotmomo/columbia-startup-studio-fall-2026/blob/team-fivegirls/teams/fivegirls/hw4-synthesis-brand-position/personas/judge-chloe.md)
- [Alex](https://github.com/imnotmomo/columbia-startup-studio-fall-2026/blob/team-fivegirls/teams/fivegirls/hw4-synthesis-brand-position/personas/judge-alex.md)

Load each relevant definition in a separate review session and give it the same version of the artifact. Record the input version, verdict, blocking feedback, revision, and rerun. The course repository also contains the installed Codex and Claude-compatible definitions and earlier review records. These definitions have not been installed in this product repository.

Use them to review major user-facing copy, landing-page changes, UX flows, or feature concepts. Their outputs are research-grounded simulations used to test decisions from different user perspectives; they are not customer interviews or demand validation.

## Feature development process

We use [Feature Forge](https://github.com/kenxle/feature-forge) because its brief, plan, build, verify, ship, and learn stages keep a small feature connected to its user problem and acceptance evidence. Next.js is our application framework.

The project workflow is recorded in `docs/feature_development.md`. Follow it through Markdown records; Feature Forge slash-command skills have not been installed.

1. **Clarify and brief:** Read the research and product docs. State the user problem, scope, unknowns, and observable acceptance criteria in a feature record.
2. **Plan:** Inspect the existing code, compare relevant implementation options, and break the work into small slices with named file ownership and checks. Record dependencies before assigning parallel work.
3. **Review the plan:** Have a separate reviewer check the requirements, route and entry distinctions, data handling, and UX. Resolve blocking findings before building. Use customer personas for relevant copy or UX questions.
4. **Build:** Implement the agreed slices. Preserve other contributors' changes. Use clearly labeled examples in prototypes; never fill missing venue facts with guesses.
5. **Verify independently:** Have a reviewer who did not build the change compare the integrated result with the acceptance criteria. Run the repository's supported checks and inspect relevant mobile/browser flows. Fix blocking issues and record evidence.
6. **Ship:** Prepare a concise change summary, validation results, and known limitations. Commit, push, open a PR, merge, or deploy only when the team has authorized that action. A teammate checks the delivered result after release.
7. **Learn:** Record useful lessons and unresolved questions in the feature record, and update project guidance when a decision changes it.

A small, understood fix can use a shorter record with the problem, changed files, verification, and outcome. It still needs appropriate checks and review.

## Running the project

This repository is currently in the setup and design phase. There is not yet a runnable application.

For the current version of the project:

1. Read `docs/brand_position.md` for product positioning and copy rules.
2. Read `docs/style_guide.md` for visual direction.
3. Read `brand/logo/README.md` and use the selected R tile assets in `brand/logo/`.
4. Load the relevant course persona definitions when reviewing user-facing copy, UX flows, or feature ideas.

No installation, build, or development command is currently required.

When application code is added, update this section with the exact:

- dependency installation command
- local development command
- test command
- build command
- required environment variables

Do not invent commands that are not actually supported by the repository.

```

The product repository includes its style history and complete logo set. Supporting research and persona reviews link to the course repository on GitHub, so they can be read without an adjacent checkout. The flow diagram describes the proposed product; it does not describe implemented routes or services.

## Source of truth

Use these sources in this order:

1. `docs/brand_position.md`
2. `docs/style_guide.md`
3. the linked course persona definitions and recorded reviews
4. supporting interview and Reddit research

If sources conflict, identify the conflict and resolve it against the underlying evidence before making a major change. Ask the team only when a decision or missing fact cannot be resolved from the records.
